;;; Commentary:

;; Change anything.el matching algorithm humanely.
;; It gives anything.el search refinement functionality.
;; exact match -> prefix match -> multiple regexp match

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;; A query of multiple regexp match is space-delimited string.
;; Anything displays candidates which matches all the regexps.
;; A regexp with "!" prefix means not matching the regexp.
;; To include spaces to a regexp, prefix "\" before space,
;; it is controlled by `anything-mp-space-regexp' variable.

;; This file highlights patterns like `occur'. Note that patterns
;; longer than `anything-mp-highlight-threshold' are highlighted. And
;; region out of screen is highlighted after
;; `anything-mp-highlight-delay' seconds.
;;
;; Highlight in Emacs is time-consuming process for slow computers. To
;; disable it is to set nil to `anything-mp-highlight-delay'.

;; Just require it to use.
