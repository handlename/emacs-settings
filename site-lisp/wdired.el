;;; Commentary:

;; wdired.el (the "w" is for writable) provides an alternative way of
;; renaming files.
;;
;; Have you ever wished to use C-x r t (string-rectangle), M-%
;; (query-replace), M-c (capitalize-word), etc. to change the name of
;; the files in a "dired" buffer? Now you can do this. All the power
;; of emacs commands are available to renaming files!
;;
;; This package provides a function that makes the filenames of a a
;; dired buffer editable, by changing the buffer mode (which inhibits
;; all of the commands of dired mode). Here you can edit the names of
;; one or more files and directories, and when you press C-c C-c, the
;; renaming takes effect and you are back to dired mode.
;;
;; Another things you can do with wdired:
;;
;; - To move files to another directory (by typing their path,
;;   absolute or relative, as a part of the new filename).
;;
;; - To change the target of symbolic links.
;;
;; - To change the permission bits of the filenames (in systems with a
;;   working unix-alike `dired-chmod-program'). See and customize the
;;   variable `wdired-allow-to-change-permissions'. To change a single
;;   char (toggling between its two more usual values) you can press
;;   the space bar over it or left-click the mouse. To set any char to
;;   an specific value (this includes the SUID, SGID and STI bits) you
;;   can use the key labeled as the letter you want. Please note that
;;   permissions of the links cannot be changed in that way, because
;;   the change would affect to their targets, and this would not be
;;   WYSIWYG :-).
;;
;; - To mark files for deletion, by deleting their whole filename.
;;
;; I do not have a URL to hang wdired, but you can use the one below
;; to find the latest version:
;;
;; http://groups.google.com/groups?as_ugroup=gnu.emacs.sources&as_q=wdired

;;; Installation:

;; Add this file (byte-compiling it is recommended) to your load-path.
;; Then add one of these set of lines (or similar ones) to your config:
;;
;; This is the easy way:
;;
;; (require 'wdired)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map "r" 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
;;
;; This is recommended way for faster emacs startup time and lower
;; memory consumption, but remind to add these lines before dired.el
;; gets loaded (i.e., near the beginning of your .emacs file):
;;
;; (autoload 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode "wdired")
;; (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
;;           '(lambda ()
;;              (define-key dired-mode-map "r" 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
;;              (define-key dired-mode-map
;;                [menu-bar immediate wdired-change-to-wdired-mode]
;;                '("Edit File Names" . wdired-change-to-wdired-mode))))
;;
;;
;; Type "M-x customize-group RET wdired" if you want make changes to
;; the default behavior.

;;; Usage:

;; Then, you can start editing the names of the files by typing "r"
;; (or whatever key you choose, or M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode).
;; Use C-c C-c when finished or C-c C-k to abort. You can use also the
;; menu options: in dired mode, "Edit File Names" under "Immediate".
;; While editing the names, a new submenu "WDired" is available at top
;; level. You can customize the behavior of this package from this
;; menu.

;;; Change Log:

;; From 1.91 to 1.9.2
;;
;; - René Kyllingstad <kyllingstad at users dot sourceforge dot net>
;;   added support for XEmacs. Reported to work under XEmacs 21.4.6.
;;
;; - Small fix to make WDired work with XEmacs 21.1. Thanks to Uwe
;;   Brauer

;; From 1.9 to 1.91
;;
;; - Fixed a bug (introduced in 1.9) so now files can be marked for
;;   deletion again, by deleting their whole filename.

;; From 1.8 to 1.9
;;
;; - Another alternative way of editing permissions allowed, see
;;   `wdired-allow-to-change-permissions' for details.
;;
;; - Now wdired doesn't rely on regexp so much. As a consequence of
;;   this, you can add newlines to filenames and symlinks targets
;;   (although this is not very usual, IMHO). Please note that dired
;;   (at least in Emacs 21.1 and previous) does not work very well
;;   with filenames with newlines in them, so RET is deactivated in
;;   wdired mode. But you can activate it if you want.
;;
;; - Now `upcase-word' `capitalize-word' and `downcase-word' are not
;;   advised to work better with wdired mode, but the keys bound to
;;   them use wdired versions of those commands.
;;
;; - Now "undo" actions are not inherited from wdired mode when
;;   changing to dired mode.
;;
;; - Code and documentation cleanups.
;;
;; - Fixed a bug that was making wdired to fail on users with
;;   `dired-backup-overwrite' set to t.
;;
;; - C-c C-[ now abort changes.

;; From 1.7 to 1.8
;;
;; - Now permission (access-control) bits of the files can be changed.
;;   Please see the commentary section and the custom variable
;;   `wdired-allow-to-change-permissions' for details.
;;
;; - Added another possible value for the variable
;;   `wdired-always-move-to-filename-beginning', useful to change
;;   permission bits of several files without the cursor jumping to
;;   filenames when changing lines.

;; From 0.1 to 1.7

;; - I've moved the list of changes to another file, because it was
;;   huge. Ask me for it or search older versions in google.

;;; TODO:

;; - Make it to work in XEmacs. Any volunteer?
