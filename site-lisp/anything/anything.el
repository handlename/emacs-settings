;;; Commentary:

;;
;; Start with M-x anything, narrow the list by typing some pattern,
;; select with up/down/pgup/pgdown/C-p/C-n/C-v/M-v, choose with enter,
;; left/right moves between sources. With TAB actions can be selected
;; if the selected candidate has more than one possible action.
;;
;; Note that anything.el provides only the framework and some example
;; configurations for demonstration purposes. See anything-config.el
;; for practical, polished, easy to use configurations which can be
;; used to assemble a custom personalized configuration. And many
;; other configurations are in the EmacsWiki.

;;
;; Maintainer's configuration is in the EmacsWiki. It would tell you
;; many tips to write smart sources!

;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;; You can extend `anything' by writing plug-ins. As soon as
;; `anything' is invoked, `anything-sources' is compiled into basic
;; attributes, then compiled one is used during invocation.
;;
;; The oldest built-in plug-in is `type' attribute: appends
;; appropriate element of `anything-type-attributes'. Second built-in
;; plug-in is `candidates-in-buffer': selecting a line from candidates
;; buffer.
;;
;; To write a plug-in:
;; 1. Define a compiler: anything-compile-source--*
;; 2. Add compier function to `anything-compile-source-functions'.
;; 3. (optional) Write helper functions.
;;
;; Anything plug-ins are found in the EmacsWiki.
;;

;; Tested on Emacs 22/23.
;;
;;
;; Thanks to Vagn Johansen for ideas.
;; Thanks to Stefan Kamphausen for fixes and XEmacs support.
;; Thanks to Tassilo Horn for fixes.
;; Thanks to Drew Adams for various fixes (frame, isearch, customization, etc.)
;; Thanks to IMAKADO for candidates-in-buffer idea.
;; Thanks to Tomohiro MATSUYAMA for multiline patch.

;;; (@* "Index")

;;  If you have library `linkd.el', load
;;  `linkd.el' and turn on `linkd-mode' now.  It lets you easily
;;  navigate around the sections  Linkd mode will

;;; (@* "INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES")

;; v1.277
;;
;;   Default setting of `anything-save-configuration-functions' is changed.
;;   Anything saves/restores window configuration instead of frame configuration now.
;;   The default is changed because flickering is occurred in some environment.
;;
;;   If you want to save and restore frame configuration, set this variable to
;;    '(set-frame-configuration . current-frame-configuration)
;;
;; v1.276
;;
;;   Fitting frame is disabled by default, because some flickering occurred
;;   in some environment.  To enable fitting, set both
;;   `anything-inhibit-fit-frame-flag' and `fit-frame-inhibit-fitting' to
;;   nil.
;;
;; v1.114
;;
;;   `anything-attr' returns nil when the source attribute is defined
;;   but the value of attribute is nil, eg. (volatile) cell. Use
;;   `anything-attr-defined' when testing whether the attribute is
;;   defined.

;;; (@* "Tips")

;;
;; If you want to create anything sources, yasnippet would help you.
;; http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/
;;
;; Then get the snippet from
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/anything-source.yasnippet
;;
;; Put it in ~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet/snippets/text-mode/emacs-lisp-mode/


;;
;; `anything-interpret-value' is useful function to interpret value
;; like `candidates' attribute.
;;
;; (anything-interpret-value "literal")            ; => "literal"
;; (anything-interpret-value (lambda () "lambda")) ; => "lambda"
;; (let ((source '((name . "lambda with source name"))))
;;   (anything-interpret-value
;;    (lambda () anything-source-name)
;;    source))                             ; => "lambda with source name"
;; (flet ((f () "function symbol"))
;;   (anything-interpret-value 'f))        ; => "function symbol"
;; (let ((v "variable symbol"))
;;   (anything-interpret-value 'v))        ; => "variable symbol"
;; (anything-interpret-value 'unbounded-1) ; error

;;
;; Now symbols are acceptable as candidates. So you do not have to use
;; `symbol-name' function. The source is much simpler. For example,
;; `apropos-internal' returns a list of symbols.
;;
;;   (anything
;;    '(((name . "Commands")
;;       (candidates . (lambda () (apropos-internal anything-pattern 'commandp)))
;;       (volatile)
;;       (action . describe-function))))

;;
;; To mark a candidate, press C-SPC as normal Emacs marking. To go to
;; marked candidate, press M-[ or M-].

;;
;; `anything-map' is now Emacs-standard key bindings by default. If
;; you are using `iswitchb', execute `anything-iswitchb-setup'. Then
;; some key bindings are adjusted to `iswitchb'. Note that
;; anything-iswitchb is not maintained.

;;
;; There are many `anything' applications, using `anything' for
;; selecting candidate. In this case, if there is one candidate or no
;; candidate, popping up *anything* buffer is irritating. If one
;; candidate, you want to select it at once. If no candidate, you want
;; to quit `anything'. Set `anything-execute-action-at-once-if-one'
;; and `anything-quit-if-no-candidate' to non-nil to remedy it. Note
;; that setting these variables GLOBALLY is bad idea because of
;; delayed sources. These are meant to be let-binded.
;; See anything-etags.el for example.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (install-elisp "http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/anything-etags.el")
;;
;; ex.
;; (let ((anything-execute-action-at-once-if-one t)
;;       (anything-quit-if-no-candidate (lambda () (message "No candidate"))))
;;    (anything temporary-sources input))

;;
;; `set-frame-configuration' arises flickering. If you hate
;; flickering, eval:
;; (setq anything-save-configuration-functions
;;    '(set-window-configuration . current-window-configuration))
;; at the cost of restoring frame configuration (only window configuration).

;;
;; `anything-delete-current-selection' deletes the current line.
;; It is useful when deleting a candidate in persistent action.
;; eg. `kill-buffer'.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-delete-current-selection)

;;
;; `anything-attr' gets the attribute. `anything-attrset' sets the
;; attribute. `anything-attr-defined' tests whether the attribute is
;; defined. They handles source-local variables.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-attr)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-attrset)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-attr-defined)

;;
;; `anything-sources' accepts many attributes to make your life easier.
;; Now `anything-sources' accepts a list of symbols.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-sources)

;;
;; `anything' has optional arguments. Now you do not have to let-bind
;; `anything-sources'.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything)

;;
;; `anything-resume' resumes last `anything' session. Now you do not
;; have to retype pattern.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-resume)

;;
;; `anything-execute-persistent-action' executes action without
;; quitting `anything'. When popping up a buffer in other window by
;; persistent action, you can scroll with `anything-scroll-other-window' and
;; `anything-scroll-other-window-down'. See also `anything-sources' docstring.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-execute-persistent-action)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-sources)

;;
;; `anything-select-2nd-action', `anything-select-3rd-action' and
;; `anything-select-4th-action' select other than default action
;; without pressing Tab.

;;
;; Using `anything-candidate-buffer' and the candidates-in-buffer
;; attribute is much faster than traditional "candidates and match"
;; way. And `anything-current-buffer-is-modified' avoids to
;; recalculate candidates for unmodified buffer. See docstring of
;; them.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-candidate-buffer)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-candidates-in-buffer)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-current-buffer-is-modified)

;;
;; `anything-current-buffer' and `anything-buffer-file-name' stores
;; `(current-buffer)' and `buffer-file-name' in the buffer `anything'
;; is invoked. Use them freely.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-current-buffer)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-buffer-file-name)

;;
;; `anything-completing-read' and `anything-read-file-name' are
;; experimental implementation. If you are curious, type M-x
;; anything-read-string-mode. It is a minor mode and toggles on/off.

;;
;; Use `anything-test-candidates' to test your handmade anything
;; sources. It simulates contents of *anything* buffer with pseudo
;; `anything-sources' and `anything-pattern', without side-effect. So
;; you can unit-test your anything sources! Let's TDD!
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-test-candidates)
;;
;; There are many unit-testing framework in Emacs Lisp. See the EmacsWiki.
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/UnitTesting
;;
;; There is an unit-test by Emacs Lisp Expectations at the tail of this file.

  "Select anything. In Lisp program, some optional arguments can be used.

Note that all the optional arguments are prefixed because of
dynamic scope problem, IOW argument variables may eat
already-bound variables. Yuck!

- ANY-SOURCES

  Temporary value of `anything-sources'.  It also accepts a
  symbol, interpreted as a variable of an anything source.  It
  also accepts an alist representing an anything source, which is
  detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES)


- ANY-INPUT

  Temporary value of `anything-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

- ANY-PROMPT

  Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

- ANY-RESUME

  If t, Resurrect previously instance of `anything'. Skip the initialization.
  If 'noresume, this instance of `anything' cannot be resumed.

- ANY-PRESELECT

  Initially selected candidate. Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.
  Note that it is not working with delayed sources.

- ANY-BUFFER

  `anything-buffer' instead of *anything*.

- ANY-KEYMAP

  `anything-map' for current `anything' session.

  "Get candidates from the candidates buffer according to `anything-pattern'.

BUFFER is `anything-candidate-buffer' by default.  Each
candidate must be placed in one line.  This function is meant to
be used in candidates-in-buffer or candidates attribute of an
anything source.  Especially fast for many (1000+) candidates.

eg.
 '((name . \"many files\")
   (init . (lambda () (with-current-buffer (anything-candidate-buffer 'local)
                        (insert-many-filenames))))

+===============================================================+
| The new way of making and narrowing candidates: Using buffers |
+===============================================================+

By default, `anything' makes candidates by evaluating the
candidates function, then narrows them by `string-match' for each
candidate.

But this way is very slow for many candidates. The new way is
storing all candidates in a buffer and narrowing them by
`re-search-forward'. Search function is customizable by search
attribute. The important point is that buffer processing is MUCH
FASTER than string list processing and is the Emacs way.

The init function writes all candidates to a newly-created
candidate buffer.  The candidates buffer is created or specified
by `anything-candidate-buffer'.  Candidates are stored in a line.

The candidates function narrows all candidates, IOW creates a
subset of candidates dynamically. It is the task of
`anything-candidates-in-buffer'.  As long as
`anything-candidate-buffer' is used,`(candidates-in-buffer)' is
sufficient in most cases.

Note that `(candidates-in-buffer)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . anything-candidates-in-buffer)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
And `(candidates-in-buffer . func)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . func)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
The expansion is performed in `anything-get-sources'.

The candidates-in-buffer attribute implies the volatile attribute.
The volatile attribute is needed because `anything-candidates-in-buffer'
creates candidates dynamically and need to be called everytime
`anything-pattern' changes.

Because `anything-candidates-in-buffer' plays the role of `match' attribute
function, specifying `(match identity)' makes the source slightly faster.

To customize `anything-candidates-in-buffer' behavior, use search,
get-line and search-from-end attributes. See also `anything-sources' docstring.
